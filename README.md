# NFL Weather Impact Analysis

## Objective
The project aims to provide insights into how weather conditions influence NFL ticket sales. By analyzing weather data and correlating it with average ticket prices, the goal is to help ticket pricers make informed decisions on adjusting prices based on weather conditions.

## Background
NFL ticket pricers often overlook climate implications when setting ticket prices. This project seeks to bridge this gap by utilizing weather data to understand consumer behavior and optimize ticket pricing accordingly.

## Page Descriptions

### 1. Weather Information Page
This page provides current weather information for any city. If a city associated with an NFL team is entered, it returns the average ticket price and temperature during their season. The future goal is to develop a formula for dynamic ticket pricing based on weather conditions relative to average temperatures.

### 2. About Us Page
This page offers a brief introduction to the project team and meets homework requirements. It highlights the unique approach to design and development.

## Research Summary

### [YouGov - Cold Weather Sports Attendance](https://business.yougov.com/content/48435-new-data-reveals-thresholds-for-cold-weather-sports-attendance)
The YouGov study stands out by diverging from conventional bootstrap use and emphasizes a personalized design approach, showcasing a commitment to uniqueness.

### [ScienceDirect - CSS "calc" Function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211973620300805)
This source discusses extensive use of the "calc" prompt in coding practices, indicating a sophisticated approach to web development with an emphasis on dynamic and responsive design elements.

### [Earth Networks - Weather and Sports](https://earthnetworks.com/blog/weather-and-sports-5-ways-changes-the-game/)
The Earth Networks article makes notable use of preset colors for a visually cohesive and harmonious aesthetic. It categorizes weather impacts on sports (extreme heat, cold, snow, rain) for a comprehensive exploration.

### [WeatherSports Repository](https://github.com/chrismojekwu/WeatherSports?tab=readme-ov-file)
This repository allows users to input a city and displays activities based on location, offering a potential data source to enhance project insights.

### [Minimus Repository](https://github.com/hamedbaatour/minimus)
The Minimus repository features a simple weather app displaying temperature based on city name, serving as a source of inspiration for weather data integration.

## Future Enhancements
- **Data Expansion:**
Gather more data to enhance project insights.
- **Dynamic Pricing:**
Implement suggested raise/lower of prices based on weather conditions.
- **Application Refinement:**
Aim to create a robust and user-friendly application through continuous coding improvements.

The project holds the promise of becoming a valuable application for NFL ticket pricers once further development is complete.

*I used a lot of CHATGPT to help me figure out the JavaScript. The rest I used with my resources on GitHub and W3 along with what we learned in class. For example, In the javascript that I coded, I would copy and paste that into chat gpt with nothing else and the system could find the problem in the code.*
